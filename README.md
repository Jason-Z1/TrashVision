## Project Overview

**TrashVision** is an innovative web application that uses artificial intelligence to help users make informed recycling decisions. By leveraging Azure Custom Vision AI, our app analyzes photos of waste items and provides instant classification with recycling recommendations.

### **Mission Statement**
*"The Planet is Waiting. The Time is Now."* - Empowering individuals to make sustainable choices through AI-powered guidance, inspired by Gaia, the Earth goddess who reminds us that our planet is the original resource.

{
  "detected_items": [
    {
      "type": "recyclable",
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "recyclable": true
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Recyclable item can be placed in recycling bin"
  ]
}
```
